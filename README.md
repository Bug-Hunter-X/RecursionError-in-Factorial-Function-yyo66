# RecursionError in Factorial Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: forgetting to handle the base case properly. The `factorial.py` file contains a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  However, it does not handle negative input correctly, which leads to infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`. The `factorialSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function that handles negative input gracefully.
